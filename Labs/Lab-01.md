# Create and Deploy a Form Recognizer Custom Model

### Overview
In this lab, you will create (train) an Azure Form Recognizer custom model using a sample training dataset. Custom models extract and analyze distinct data and use cases from forms and documents specific to your business. To create a custom model, you label a dataset of documents with the values you want to extract and train the model on the labeled dataset. You only need five examples of the same form or document type to get started.
